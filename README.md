## General Information
- **Background of the project** : You work for a consumer finance company which specialises in lending various types of loans to urban customers. When the company receives a loan application, the company has to make a decision for loan approval based on the applicant’s profile. 

- **Business probem that the project is trying to solve**: The company wants to understand the driving factors (or driver variables) behind loan default, i.e. the variables which are strong indicators of default.  The company can utilise this knowledge for its portfolio and risk assessment.

- **Dataset** : The dataset contains the complete loan data for all loans issued through the time period 2007 to 2011.


## Conclusions
- The Loan Purpose – 'small_business', 'renewable_energy' and 'educational' have highest risk of default.
- Iterating income from high to low, we are able to see a 6% increase in default rate.
- As per the business industry, one of the crucial factors that affects 'default_rate' is the purpose-of-the-loan : such as the performance of home-loans varies from that of credit-cards, on the other hand credit-cards are poles aprt from debt-consolidation-loans etc.
